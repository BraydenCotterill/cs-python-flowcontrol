    "When you start a new line after a colon your code (if writing it inside IDLE) you should find your code indented).  Lines will keep indenting until you press backspace.  Python knows that anything indented is inside the structure with the colon - in this case the if.  Indenting is considered good practice in all programming languages as it makes code easier to read but in Python it is even more important as it affects the code’s meaning."
